# FriendFinder

### Stack
* Express (router)
* Node.js
* Bootstrap
* Jquery

### How it works:
The user can take a quiz and find a match based on their answers. After taking the quiz the user is also a "friend" temporarily saved to the json data. Using the "API" link on the homepage you can access the json data. If you want to be specific you can enter the friends name after /api/friends/|yourfriendhere| and it will pull their specific data.
